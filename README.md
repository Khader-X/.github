# KhaderX (KHX)

**KHX** (short for *KhaderX*) is the official open-source brand of [Khader Abueltayef](https://github.com/KhaderDev).  
It represents a personal commitment to building professional, user-friendly, and extensible Python packages.

---

## ✨ Vision
- Create reliable and elegant tools for **Aerospace Engineering**, **Scientific Computing**, and **Developer Productivity**.  
- Share well-documented, user-friendly libraries that make life easier for engineers and developers.  
- Explore the “X” — the limitless possibilities of Python and problem-solving.

---

## 📦 Package Naming
All packages follow a **consistent prefix**:

- `khx_<name>` → PyPI name  
- `Khader-X/khx_<name>` → GitHub repository  

Example:
- [**khx_rich_console**](https://github.com/Khader-X/khx_rich_console) → colorful toolkit for terminal text, lines, tables, and progress.  
- Future packages will follow the same rule (e.g., `khx_safe_runner`, `khx_tabletools`).

## 📚 Repositories
- [`khx_rich_console`](https://github.com/Khader-X/khx_rich_console) — Rich, colorful console printing toolkit.  
*(more packages coming soon…)*

## 🔖 License
All KHX packages are released under the **MIT License**, encouraging collaboration and community contributions.
